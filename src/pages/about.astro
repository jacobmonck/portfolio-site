  <h1 class="mb-6 text-3xl font-semibold">About</h1>
  <p class="mb-4 max-w-2xl text-zinc-300">
    I am currently a Computer Science major at James Madison University,
    expecting to graduate in 2028. My focus lies primarily in backend systems,
    API development, data modeling, and building tooling that supports efficient
    workflows.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 max-w-2xl text-zinc-300">
    When approaching software development, I prioritize clarity and correctness,
    aiming to write code that is maintainable and easy to understand. I
    recognize that every design decision involves tradeoffs, so I strive to
    balance simplicity and functionality based on the context.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 max-w-2xl text-zinc-300">
    Through my coursework and personal projects, I have built a solid foundation
    in computer science fundamentals and practical engineering skills. I am
    interested in continuing to deepen my understanding of system design and
    improving the reliability of the software I work on.
  </p>
  <div class="max-w-2xl text-sm text-zinc-400">
    <strong>Outside of class:</strong> I enjoy exploring new programming languages,
    reading about software architecture, and contributing to open-source projects
    to apply what I’ve learned in real-world scenarios.
