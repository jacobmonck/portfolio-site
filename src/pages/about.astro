  <p class="text-zinc-300 max-w-2xl mb-4">
    I am currently a Computer Science major at James Madison University, expecting to graduate in 2028. My focus lies primarily in backend systems, API development, data modeling, and building tooling that supports efficient workflows.
  </p>
  <p class="text-zinc-300 max-w-2xl mb-4">
    When approaching software development, I prioritize clarity and correctness, aiming to write code that is maintainable and easy to understand. I recognize that every design decision involves tradeoffs, so I strive to balance simplicity and functionality based on the context.
  </p>
  <p class="text-zinc-300 max-w-2xl mb-4">
    Through my coursework and personal projects, I have built a solid foundation in computer science fundamentals and practical engineering skills. I am interested in continuing to deepen my understanding of system design and improving the reliability of the software I work on.
  </p>

    <strong>Outside of class:</strong> I enjoy exploring new programming languages, reading about software architecture, and contributing to open-source projects to apply what I’ve learned in real-world scenarios.
